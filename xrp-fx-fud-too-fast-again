I want to better illustrate the whole XRP too fast FUD.

How fast a crypto currency can be transferred has nothing to do with how a market will determine its price. 

Take a minute to consider how BTC is being traded on a exchange.  Orders are commited and executed instantly, meaning you can actually 
trade your BTC the minute you buy them (or the next second if you are really fast).

But order books are getting filled only as fast as there are matches between buyer and seller. There are some sellers willing to wait 
longer for a higher price, etc. If you have ever placed a limit order you know that there is a correlation with how far you deviate from 
the current price and how much time that might take to get there.

None of this has anything to do with BTC taking 30 minutes to be transferred! BTCs are cycled instantly inside the walls of an exchange.

This should be clear as ice now.  If you're in doubt just plug in 0 seconds in the FUDster's formula and that will turn the XRP to zero,
because they are essentially saying that faster means cheaper.  Simply not relevant.
